# ECM-2434-Group-Software-Engineering-Project
This module will introduce you to those aspects of software engineering that relate to the requirements analysis and production of large systems by the application of programming techniques to a large and complex project in a team-working environment. The main objectives of this module are to introduce key aspects of software engineering to you in a practical way. Aspects of software engineering that will be covered in this module include application of programming techniques to large-scale software system development, requirements analysis, human computer interface (HCI) design, software system design and development, software system testing and software system integration and deployment. They also include project documentation, project management and teamworking.
